# This project will display a pizza store simulator that will automate the process of customizing their pizza, ranging from toppings, drinks, and sides to an extensive list of what the establishment offers. Once the customer is satisfied with their choices, they will be shown the bill as the receipt. The reason we chose this topic is to show how the use of automation can make such simple tasks in this industry much more seamless for the user. Allowing the customer the option to select their toppings instead of attempting to talk to an individual makes the process faster and avoids any possible mistakes that could happen throughout the order.
